# SICP
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (In Clojure)
----------------

I already enjoy Scala and Haskell quite a bit, but haven't spent much time with any Lisp dialect so figured SICP would be a great introduction. Rather than use Scheme or Racket I decided to go with Clojure.

All of the exercises should be prefixed by a brief description of the problem at hand, followed by a stand-alone solution.
